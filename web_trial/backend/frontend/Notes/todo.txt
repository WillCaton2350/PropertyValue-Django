Notes
ğŸš« - Calendar pop-up when the "schedule a visit" Icon is selected. 
 + Calendar logic/functionality once a date is seleced / locked in. 
 + There can only be one date mm/dd/yyyy 
  * there will never be another 09/21/1997 in existence so the moment a date is blocked off on the schedule, it should be saved in the database.
  * Possibly needs for there to be a UI visual / pop-up of the confirmation or an automated email that gets sent once the date metadata is migrated the database.
